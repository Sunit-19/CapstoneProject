Student Attrition Model
Clearwater State University has collected student data to check the enrollment to the curriculum programs and  the percentage students continuing to the next year

It was observed that many students are opting out from continuing the next year. 
The rate of attrition was around 23 - 25%.

An exercise was done to collect data from all enrolled students and the reasons why they did not continue their studies

Data analysis and visualization techniques are used to arrive the root cause of attrition and develop a strategic retention plan
